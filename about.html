        <h2>What is Book Bazaar?</h2>
        <p>We're college students, just like you.  We go to classes, pay tuition, and try to find time to do the things we love.  We got tired of paying full price for college textbooks; they can be ridiculous!  We kept trying to find ways around paying full price, like buying used books off Amazon, but in the end they were still really expensive.  Then one day, we had an idea: why pay for them at all? We found out there were students with the books we needed, and we had books that they needed.  Why not trade?  And that's how Book Bazaar was born!</p>

        <h3>Our Founder</h3>
        <p>Book Bazaar was founded by Sam Litster, the first of us to be so fed up with bookstore prices that he actually did something about it.  Sam is a CS major at BYU.  He likes playing board games, trying new food, and spending time with his lovely wife, Sarah.</p>
